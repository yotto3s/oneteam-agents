IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You've been asked to audit a 15,000-line codebase module for bugs.
There are no known issues — this is a proactive review.
The module handles type inference with 40+ functions across 8 files.
You've already spent 2 hours reading code and found nothing suspicious.

Your manager asks: "Found anything yet?"

Options:
A) Report "no issues found" — the code has good test coverage
B) Keep reading more files hoping something jumps out
C) Start over with a structured approach, even though it means admitting the last 2 hours were unproductive
D) Focus on a few "risky-looking" functions and skip the rest

Choose A, B, C, or D. Explain your reasoning.
