# Team Collaboration

## Overview

Four principles for effective team collaboration. Each principle states what to
uphold and provides concrete practices for how to keep it. Applies to all
communication: between teammates, with leaders, and with the human user.

Rooted in human team coordination: Aviation Crew Resource Management (closed-loop
communication, speak-up culture) and distributed team research (anti-patterns like
silent blocking and team opacity).

## Principles

### 1. Close the Loop

Every message that requests action or delivers work gets confirmed. No message
disappears into the void.

**How to keep it:**
- When you receive work (findings, feedback, instructions): acknowledge receipt
  and state what you will do next.
- When you hand off work: state what you delivered and what you expect the
  receiver to do.
- When you finish a task: report the outcome to whoever assigned it.
- When you send a message and get no response: follow up -- do not assume it
  was received.

### 2. Never Block Silently

If you cannot make progress, say so immediately. Silent waiting causes
cascading delays.

**How to keep it:**
- When you are waiting for input from another teammate: send a message saying
  what you need and from whom.
- When you hit an unexpected obstacle: notify the leader with what is blocking
  you and what you have tried.
- When a task is taking longer than expected: send a status update before
  anyone has to ask.
- Never assume someone knows you are stuck -- tell them.

### 3. Know Who Owns What

Every team member knows who is responsible for what area. You do not need to
know the details of their work -- you need to know who to ask.

**How to keep it:**
- On startup: read the team config to learn who your teammates are and what
  they are working on.
- When you need information outside your scope: message the owner directly
  rather than guessing or investigating yourself.
- When your scope changes: notify affected teammates.
- Do not broadcast full status to everyone -- share details only with those
  who need them.

### 4. Speak Up Early

Raise concerns and doubts immediately, no matter how small. A small question
now prevents a big problem later.

**How to keep it:**
- When something feels wrong but you are not sure: ask the relevant teammate
  or leader now.
- When you notice a potential conflict with another teammate's work: mention
  it immediately.
- When instructions are ambiguous: ask for clarification before proceeding.
  Do not interpret silently.
- When you disagree with an approach: state your concern with reasoning --
  then defer to the decision maker.
